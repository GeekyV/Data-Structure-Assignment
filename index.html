        <h2>What is Stack?</h2>
        <img class="image" src="images/Stack.png"></img>

        <p>
            In computing, a stack is a data structure used to store a collection of objects.
            Individual items can be added and stored in a stack using a push operation.
            Objects can be retrieved using a pop operation, which removes an item from the stack.
        </p>

        <p>
            When an object is added to a stack, it is placed on the top of all previously entered items.
            When an item is removed, it can either be removed from the top or bottom of the stack.
            A stack in which items are removed the top is considered a "LIFO" (Last In, First Out) stack.
            You can picture a LIFO stack as a deck of cards where you lay individual cards on the deck,
            then draw cards from the top.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stacks have several applications in commuter programming. LIFO stacks, for example, can be used to retrieve recently
            used objects, from a cache. FIFO stacks may be used to ensure data is retrieved in the order it was
            entered, which may be used for processing data in a queue. While stacks are commonly used by software
            programmers, you will typically not notice them while using a program.

        <h2> Stack Operations</h2>
          

               <ul>
                   <li>
                       <b>Push</b> - Push operation refers to inserting an element in the stack. Since there’s only one position at
                       which the new element can be inserted — Top of the stack, the new element is inserted at the top of the
                       stack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Pop</b> - Pop operation refers to the removal of an element. Again, since we only have access to the element
                        at the top of the stack, there’s only one element that we can remove. We just remove the top of the stack.
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Peek</b> - Peek operation allows the user to see the element on the top of the stack. The stack is not modified
                        in any manner in this operation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>isEmpty</b> - To prevent performing operations on an empty stack, the programmer is required to internally
                        maintain the size of the stack which will be updated during push and pop operations accordingly.
                        isEmpty() conventionally returns a boolean value: True if size is 0, else False.
                    </li>
                </ul>
